# Mesop Playground ðŸŽ®

Just me playing around with [Mesop](https://github.com/google/mesop) - a Python web framework.

## What's this?

A collection of small examples as I learn Mesop. Each file shows different features I've been exploring.

## Examples

- **hello_world.py** - Basic "Hello World"
- **counter.py** - Simple counter with state
- **loading.py** - Loading states and async stuff
- **streaming.py** - Real-time data updates
- **multi_page.py** - Navigation between pages

## Run it

```bash
# Install Mesop
pip install mesop

# Run the main app
mesop main.py

# Or run individual examples
mesop examples/counter.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:3210` in your browser.

## Why Mesop?

I was curious about building web apps with just Python. Mesop lets you do that - no HTML/CSS/JS needed (well, it handles that for you).

Pretty cool for quick prototypes and learning!
