# Mesop Playground ðŸŽ®

Just me playing around with [Mesop](https://github.com/google/mesop) - a Python web framework.

## What's this?

A collection of examples showing my learning journey with Mesop, from basic concepts to building real applications.

## Examples

- **hello_world.py** - Basic "Hello World"
- **counter.py** - Simple counter with state management
- **loading.py** - Loading states and async operations
- **streaming.py** - Real-time data updates demo
- **multi_page.py** - Navigation between pages
- **log_monitor.py** - Real database application with PostgreSQL

## Run it

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the main app
mesop main.py

# Or run individual examples
mesop examples/counter.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:3210` in your browser.

## What I've Built

This repo shows my progression from basic Mesop concepts to building practical applications:

1. **Foundation** - Basic syntax, state management, events
2. **Log Monitor** - A real database application for monitoring logs from an RDS instance
3. **Future Plans** - CRUD operations, natural language queries, Docker setup

## Why Mesop?

I was curious about building web apps with just Python. Mesop lets you do that - no HTML/CSS/JS needed (well, it handles that for you).

Pretty cool for quick prototypes and learning!
